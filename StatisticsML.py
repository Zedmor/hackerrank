# Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history:
#
# Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
# History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15
# Compute Karl Pearsonâ€™s coefficient of correlation between these scores.
# Compute the answer correct to three decimal places.
#
# Output Format
#
# In the text box, enter the floating point/decimal value required. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces. Your answer may look like: 0.255
#
# This is NOT the actual answer - just the format in which you should provide your answer.
